# F-Droid

Request for inclusion is at https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues/17.

## Beta

You have two solutions for beta releases:

- Use a different app ID so we can package is separately (we do this for Nextcloud dev, for example).
- Use Git tags with a with a -betaÂ suffix so we can package it but don't set it as the current version (we do this for ownCloud, 2.9.0-beta.2 can be installed with the F-Droid client but it has to be selected explicitly by the user).
